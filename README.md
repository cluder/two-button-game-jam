## Version 1.0 / 1.1
Version 1.1 was the version submitted to the game gam.
Runnable jar [two_button_jam.jar](https://github.com/cluder/two-button-game-jam/releases/download/v1.1/two_button_jam_v1.1.jar)

## version 1.x
additional improvements after game jam:
* gauge to visualize the fire cooldown
* ability to resize the window (scaling after a resize is not fully working)

## known problems
* Jumping is not fully framrate independent, if you dont get 60 fps, you wont get the full jumping height.
